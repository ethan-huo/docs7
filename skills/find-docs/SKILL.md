# docs7 — Library Documentation Finder

Find library documentation, then read the full source documents. Two-step workflow: **search → read**.

Binary: `docs7`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Find documentation sources

```bash
docs7 docs <library-name> "<query>"
```

This returns a list of relevant documents with descriptions, plus their URLs.

```bash
# Examples
docs7 docs mlx-swift "GPU stream thread safety"
docs7 docs sparkle "appcast auto update configuration"
docs7 docs convex "Swift client authentication"
```

If you already know the library ID (format `/owner/repo`), pass it directly:

```bash
docs7 docs /ml-explore/mlx-swift "lazy evaluation"
```

### Step 2: Read the full documents

Pick the most relevant URL(s) from Step 1 and read them:

```bash
docs7 read <url>
```

The `read` command auto-detects the URL type:

| URL pattern | Strategy |
|---|---|
| `github://owner/repo/path` | GitHub API (authenticated via `gh auth`) |
| `https://github.com/.../blob/...` | GitHub API (auto-converted) |
| `https://...` (serves markdown) | Direct fetch with `Accept: text/markdown` |
| `https://...` (serves HTML) | Jina Reader fallback → clean markdown |
| `https://...` (JS/SPA page) | `docs7 read -f <url>` → Cloudflare Browser Rendering (full JS rendering) |

Results are cached for 1 hour at `~/.cache/docs7/`. Use `--no-cache` to force a fresh fetch.

### Navigating large documents

Documents over 2000 lines are automatically truncated to the first 1000 lines, with a hint appended at the end of stdout. Use `--toc` and `-s` to navigate:

```bash
# View the document outline (section numbers + line counts)
docs7 read <url> --toc
# output:
#   1 Getting Started (68)
#   1.1 Installation (12)
#   1.2 Quick Start (25)
#   2 API Reference (300)
#   2.1 Authentication (45)

# Read a specific section by number
docs7 read <url> -s 1.2

# Read multiple sections
docs7 read <url> -s "1,3.1,6.2"

# Read a range of sections (by TOC position, inclusive)
docs7 read <url> -s "1-3"

# Mix ranges and singles
docs7 read <url> -s "1-2,3.2-5.1,6.2"
```

Use `--toc` first to find section numbers and estimate size, then `-s` to read specific sections.

### Putting it together

```bash
# 1. Find
docs7 docs react "useEffect cleanup async"
# output:
#   1. **React Hooks Reference**
#      - ...
#   ---
#   - github://facebook/react/docs/hooks-reference.md

# 2. Read the most relevant one
docs7 read github://facebook/react/docs/hooks-reference.md
```

## Writing Good Queries

The query directly affects result quality. Be specific.

| Quality | Example |
|---|---|
| Good | `"SwiftUI NavigationStack path binding programmatic navigation"` |
| Good | `"Express.js middleware error handling async"` |
| Bad | `"navigation"` |
| Bad | `"middleware"` |

Include the programming language or framework name when ambiguous.

## When to use `search` instead of `docs`

Use `docs7 search` when you need to **find the right library first**, before querying its docs:

```bash
# "Which library is this?"
docs7 search swift-testing
docs7 search convex "mobile client"
```

This returns a ranked list of matching libraries with IDs you can feed to `docs`.

## Limits

- Do not call `docs7 docs` more than 3 times per question. Use the best result you have.
- Coverage is best for libraries with GitHub repos or documentation sites. Apple-native C APIs (CoreAudio, CGEventTap) are not indexed — use the `apple-docs` skill for those.
