name: ctx
description: >-
  Search and read documentation for libraries, frameworks, SDKs, and APIs by name and query.
  Read any URL or local file as clean markdown (GitHub repos, doc sites, JS-rendered SPAs).
  Navigate large documents with TOC and section extraction.
  Screenshot webpages, extract links, scrape elements by CSS selector, extract structured
  JSON data, and crawl entire documentation sites.

## Core Workflow: search → read

### 1. Find documentation sources

```bash
ctx docs <library-name> "<query>"
```

Returns relevant document URLs. Be specific with queries — include language/framework name when ambiguous.

```bash
ctx docs mlx-swift "GPU stream thread safety"
ctx docs react "useEffect cleanup async"
ctx docs /ml-explore/mlx-swift "lazy evaluation"   # direct library ID
```

Use `ctx search <name> [query]` first if you need to find the right library.

### 2. Read documents

```bash
ctx read <url>
```

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| (positional) | | required | URL or local path (`https://`, `github://`, `file://`, `/path`, `./path`) |
| `--full` | `-f` | false | Force full JS rendering (skip HTTP attempt, use when page needs JavaScript) |
| `--no-cache` | | false | Bypass cache, always fetch fresh |
| `--toc` | | false | Show heading outline with section numbers and line counts |
| `--section` | `-s` | | Section(s) to extract (e.g. `1`, `1-3`, `1.2,3.1`) |

Auto-detects URL type and fetches accordingly:
- Local file / `file://` → direct read (always full content, no summary)
- `github://owner/repo@ref/path` → GitHub API (supports `@ref` for versioned docs)
- `https://github.com/.../blob/...` → GitHub API (auto-converted)
- `https://...` (markdown/text/JSON/XML/YAML) → direct fetch
- `https://...` (HTML/SPA) → full JS rendering fallback; use `-f` to skip the HTTP attempt

**stdout/stderr contract**: stdout is always clean document content. Diagnostic hints (incomplete content, empty page warnings) go to stderr only.

### 3. Navigate large documents

Documents over 2000 lines produce a **structural summary** instead of the full content. The output starts with `[ctx:summary]` and shows every section heading with line counts and a preview:

```
[ctx:summary] 5000 lines, 12 sections. Read sections: ctx read <url> -s <number>
Full content: ~/.cache/ctx/{hash}.md

# 1 Getting Started (45 lines)
This library provides a unified interface...
...

## 1.1 Installation (12 lines)
npm install ctx-render
...
```

**How to work with summaries**:
1. Read the summary to understand the full document structure
2. Use `-s` to read the sections you need: `ctx read <url> -s 2.1`
3. Combine sections: `ctx read <url> -s "1-3,5.2"`
4. Or read the cache file path directly for the full raw content

Use `--toc` for a compact outline without previews.

## Browser Rendering Commands

These commands require `ctx auth login cloudflare`. Each has a dedicated reference — read it before first use:

| Command | Use when | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| `ctx screenshot <url>` | Need visual information (UI, charts, layouts) | references/screenshot.md |
| `ctx links <url>` | Explore a site's link structure before reading | references/links.md |
| `ctx scrape <url> -s "selector"` | Extract specific elements (tables, code blocks) | references/scrape.md |
| `ctx json <url> --prompt "..."` | Extract structured data as JSON | references/json.md |
| `ctx crawl <url>` | Pull multiple pages from a documentation site | references/crawl.md |

All commands support `-d` for full API request body (JSON5, `@file`, or stdin). Flags override `-d` fields.

## Configuration

When you need to manage site authentication (cookies, headers), cache TTL, or viewport defaults, read references/settings.md.

Common pattern: user provides cookies/auth for a site → store as site headers → all subsequent requests are authenticated:
```bash
ctx site set example.com Cookie "sid=abc; token=xyz"
```

## Self-Improvement

When you encounter friction — a command that doesn't work as expected, a misleading instruction in this skill, or confusing parameter design — read references/feedback.md and file a GitHub issue.
